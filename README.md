# Repo for Lightning Mobs mod [1.18.2]

Let a lightning drop on mobs and you might find some will transform into stronger creatures! This mod gives tools for you to spawn and defeat bosses or create strong weapons with destructive capabilities and crowd control.

In the future, we will release an API to let you set your own bosses, you will need to send the registry name of the creature and the boss it will transform upon being struck by a special lightning.
