# Repo for Lightning Mobs mod [1.18.2]

Let a lightning drop on mobs and you might find out that some will transform into stronger creatures! This mod gives tools for you to spawn and defeat bosses or create strong weapons with destructive capabilities and crowd control.

We accept IMC so you can register your own mob upgrading. Send it with any method string and the message must be a string like this: "upgradeable_registry_name#upgraded_mob_registry_name".

This is what is planned for first alpha: Only left to do is the new mob, electric ingot and lightning sword functions.
